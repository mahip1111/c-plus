// How does the code run?  

// actually the cpp file is converted into the executable exe file with the help of the compiler which is then executed by the computer.

// can  you tell me that the exe file is executed by computer or the ide?

// An .exe file (executable file) is executed by the computer’s operating system (OS) — not by the IDE.
// Here’s how it works step-by-step 👇
// You write code in an IDE (like Code::Blocks, Dev-C++, or VS Code).
// The compiler (for example, GCC for C/C++) converts your code into machine code and produces an .exe file.
// When you run that .exe file:
// It’s actually the operating system (like Windows) that loads it into memory.
// The CPU then executes the machine instructions line by line.
// ✅ The IDE’s job is only to help you write, compile, and run the code easily — it doesn’t execute the program itself.
// 💻 The actual execution is done by the computer’s OS and CPU.

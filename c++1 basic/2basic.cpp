    cout<<"The identifier a store the value "<< a;

/* Q:- What is the difference btw the identifier and the variable?
/ Ans:- 1. An identifier is just a name we give to things in a program (like variables, functions, arrays, classes, etc.).It’s like a label.
2. A variable is a storage location in memory with a data type that holds some value.
The variable needs an identifier (name) to access it. 

In short:-
Identifier = Name
Variable = Name stored with value*/

// An array is a collection of items that are of the data type stored in contiguous memory locations. And it is also known as a subscript variable.
// It can even store the collection of derived data types such as pointers, structures, etc.
// An array can be of any dimension. The C++ Language places no limits on the number of dimensions in an array. This means we can create arrays of any number of dimensions. It could be a 2D array or a 3D array or more.

// Advantages of Arrays?
// It is used to represent multiple data items of the same type by using only a single name.
// Accessing any random item at any random position in a given array is very fast in an array.
// There is no case of memory shortage or overflow in the case of arrays since the size is fixed and elements are stored in contiguous memory locations.

// Pointers:-
// A pointer is a data type that holds the address of another data type. A pointer itself is a variable that points to any other variable. It can be of type int, char, array, function, or even any other pointer. Pointers in C++ are defined using the ‘*’ (asterisk) operator.
// The ‘&’(ampersand) operator is called the ‘address of’ operator, and the ‘*’(asterisk) operator is called the ‘value at’ dereference operator. 

// Applications of a Pointer
// Pointers are used to dynamically allocate or deallocate memory.
// Pointers are used to point to several containers such as arrays, or structs, and also for passing addresses of containers to functions.
// Return multiple values from a function
// Rather than passing a copy of a container to a function, we can simply pass its pointer. This helps reduce the memory usage of the program.
// Pointer reduces the code and improves the performance.

// Address of Operator (&):
// & is also known as the Referencing Operator. It is a unary operator. The variable name used along with the Address of operator must be the name of an already defined variable.
// Using & operator along with a variable gives the address number of the variable.


#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
 
int main()
{
    int a = 10;
    cout << "Address of variable a is " << &a << endl;
    return 0;
}

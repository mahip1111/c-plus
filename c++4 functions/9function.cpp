// REDUNDANCY: In programming, redundancy means writing or storing something more than once unnecessarily — in a way that does not add any new functionality or benefit.( that is why we use functions in the programming language to reduce the repetion part of the code. )

// LITERALS:

// In programming, literals are fixed constant values that are directly written in the code — they represent data exactly as it is.
// 👉 In simple terms, a literal is a value that doesn’t change and is used directly in a program.
// example 1 is a literal bcz uski value same ha har programming language mai and similarly all the numbers and alphabets are literals.

// 🔹 Example (in C or C++):
// int a = 10;        // 10 is an integer literal
// float b = 3.14;    // 3.14 is a floating-point literal
// char c = 'A';      // 'A' is a character literal
// string s = "Hello"; // "Hello" is a string literal
// bool flag = true;   // true is a boolean literal
